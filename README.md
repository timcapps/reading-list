# Books I've Read (...or listened to)

Welcome to my reading list! This list is here to help me remember which books I've finished and to keep any notes on them that I may want to look back on.

The [backlog](backlog.md) contains books people have recommended that I plan to get around to reading at some point.

All books are sorted into their respective genre and are sorted alphabetically.

Enjoy and happy reading!
